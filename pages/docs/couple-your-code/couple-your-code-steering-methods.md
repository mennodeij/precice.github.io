summary: "In this step, you get to know the most important API functions of preCICE: initialize, advance, and finalize."

As a first preparation step, you need to include the preCICE library headers. In C++, you need to include the file [SolverInterface.hpp](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/src/precice/SolverInterface.hpp).
The handle to the preCICE API is the class `precice::SolverInterface`. Its constructor requires the participant's name, the preCICE configuration file's name and the `rank` and `size` of the current thread. Once the basic preCICE interface is set up, we can _steer_ the behaviour of preCICE. For that we need the following functions:

```cpp
SolverInterface( String participantName, String configurationFileName, int rank, int size );
double initialize();
double advance ( double computedTimeStepLength );
void finalize();
```

What do they do?

* `initialize` establishes communication channels, sets up data structures of preCICE, and returns the maximum time step size the solver should use next. But let's ignore time step sizes for the moment. This will be the topic of [Step 5](couple-your-code-time-step-sizes.html).
* `advance` needs to be called after the computation of every time step to _advance_ the coupling. As an argument, you have to pass the solver's last time step size (`dt`). Again, the function returns the next maximum time step size you can use (`preciceDt`). More importantly, it maps coupling data between the coupling meshes, it communicates coupling data between the coupled participants, and it accelerates coupling data. One could say the complete coupling happens within this single function.
* `finalize` frees the preCICE data structures and closes communication channels.

So, let's extend the code of our fluid solver:

```cpp
#include "precice/SolverInterface.hpp"

turnOnSolver(); //e.g. setup and partition mesh

precice::SolverInterface precice("FluidSolver","precice-config.xml",rank,size); // constructor

double solverDt; // solver time step size
double preciceDt; // maximum precice time step size
double dt; // actual time step size

preciceDt = precice.initialize();
while (not simulationDone()){ // time loop
  solverDt = beginTimeStep(); // e.g. compute adaptive dt
  dt = min(preciceDt, solverDt); // more about this in Step 5
  solveTimeStep(dt);
  preciceDt = precice.advance(dt);
  endTimeStep(); // e.g. update variables, increment time
}
precice.finalize(); // frees data structures and closes communication channels
turnOffSolver();
```
